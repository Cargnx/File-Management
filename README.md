# File Management System
### Introduction
This is a learning project about an idea that came randomly in my mind which 
i found interesting.

#### I thought about a File Management System as a good learning project since:
- I/O concept is interesting to me
- How it actually works
- Using C++ basics / Advanced concepts like OOP, RAII etc
- ...

### Future ideas / Tasks
I started with an basic Write and Read File program and use this foundation 
to build from and build more functions & ideas on top of it, e.g:
- Replace hardcoded file name & content with dynamic user input
- Selection list like Move, Copy, Delete, Duplicate File and so on
- Possibly add an Algorithm for something (just thought about it...)

### What i hope to learn from this project?
- Learn more about I/O Streams
- File handling
- RAII
- Abstractions
- OOP
- Thinking as a programmer
- solving problems
- improve my code
